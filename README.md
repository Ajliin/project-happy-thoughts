# Happy Thoughts

Practicing React state skills by fetching and posting data to an API by using Technigos API to collect 'happy thoughts'
## The problem

First time of posting in API. Used postman to play around with it. useEffect for the first time, only with dependency of mounting. I approach by first pseduo coding, then one problem at the time and when I got stuck I took help from lesson.

If I had more time I will just redo everything to make sure I really grasp it.
